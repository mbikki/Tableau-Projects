## Sales YoY Performance Dashboard
ðŸ“Š Project Overview:
Developed an interactive sales performance dashboard using Tableau Public to visualize key metrics (Sales, Profit, and Quantity) with year-over-year comparisons, enabling quick identification of performance trends, anomalies, and regional patterns.

ðŸ’¡ My Contributions:

-> Collaborated with stakeholders to gather requirements and understand the business goals and user expectations.

-> Sketched dashboard wireframes and selected appropriate chart types to align with user stories.

-> Built a clean and reliable data model: connected to source files, renamed fields, validated data types, and explored the dataset for quality and usability.

-> Created dynamic calculated fields and parameters to support KPIs and flexible year selection.

-> Designed individual visualizations (line charts with min/max highlights) and refined them by formatting axes, removing unnecessary grid lines, and applying color schemes and tooltips.

-> Assembled all charts into a cohesive dashboard layout using containers, with responsive design (fit to entire view).

-> Implemented filters for Year, Region, State, City, Category, and Sub-Category to allow multi-level drill-down.

-> Published the final dashboard to Tableau Public for public access and professional showcasing.
